                <div class="accordion-panel"><p>There's a lot of styling, RWD and pseudo classes that could be applied. This also doesn't have the feature where one section panel opens and auto closes others. I got stuck on applying the click event on the button but wanted to change the display for the nested elements, wasn't sure what DOM methodds to use. The toggle from display none to 'block' is a bit jarring, maybe a transition scoll style could be applied so the movement is not instantaneous.</p></div>
