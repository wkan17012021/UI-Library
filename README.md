# UI-Library 🖥️
A collection of UI components created by others, collated for learning purposes

## I created this repo because:
- I wanted to learn about front end development beyond fundamentals and have a source for commonly used web UX design patterns 👨🏽‍🎓
- I could have just copied code from a UI library but I find that long term, this may restrict my understanding of how these components are utilised when it comes to manipulating the code for a custom project. 🧐
- Need more practice with perhaps less popular HTML tags / CSS properties / plain JS methods and data manipulation techniques. 📚
- Repetition builds the muscle memory and hopefully it will take my competence from beginner to intermediate. 💪🏽
- Trying to wean myself off e-learning platforms and tutorial hell. Although, video tutorials are my go-to source of code solutions! 🍼

Each subfolder is a design concept that I was interested in learning how they work. 

Typically, there may be another folder from the source where I got the solution. I tried to explore a couple of ways to tackle the problem and compare their functionality and performance.

I may have iterated or changed the code from the learning resource to understand how it works.

I tried to focus on solutions with plain JS / no frameworks.

Hopefully, there is a link to the resource, but if not I'm sure you can find a similar video on YT explaining the concept.
